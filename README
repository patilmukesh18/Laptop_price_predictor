### Laptop Price Predictor  

A web-based application that predicts the price of a laptop based on the configuration input by the user. The project follows the typical stages of the Machine Learning (ML) lifecycle to provide a practical business solution for predicting laptop prices.

## Business Problem  

The goal of this project is to predict the price of a laptop based on several features such as the company name, product name, laptop type, screen size, CPU model, RAM, memory, GPU, operating system, and weight.

## Dataset  

The project uses a dataset containing details for 1300 laptop models, with the following features:

- **Company Name**  
- **Product Name**  
- **Laptop Type**  
- **Screen Inches**  
- **Screen Resolution**  
- **CPU Model**  
- **RAM Characteristics**  
- **Memory**  
- **GPU Characteristics**  
- **Operating System**  
- **Laptop's Weight**  
- **Laptop's Price (Target)**

## Machine Learning Problem  

This is a **regression problem**, where the objective is to predict the price of the laptop based on the provided features.

### Performance Metrics  

- **R2 Score**: A measure of how well the model predicts the target variable.  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average absolute difference between the predicted price and the actual price.

## Technologies Used  

- **Python**: Core programming language.  
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and training machine learning models.  
- **Flask**: For building the web application interface.  
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.  
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.  
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.  
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading trained models.  

## Prerequisites
